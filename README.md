# Abstract
With marijuana now legal in California, it's now greatly important to gather data on the newly legal drug.  With much of the industry [unregulated and confusing and so much unknown about it] I decided to take the opportunity to do some of my own exploration of the data on the effects on cannabis when treating depression, anxiety and stress.  This data was retrieved from [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032718303100) with the data provided by [Strainprint](https://strainprint.ca/)
# Importance
Cannabis has shown the potential to be a possible treatement for many different ailments from depression to chronic pain.  Unfortunatly there has been decades of negative propaganda against cannabis that has given it a stigma and thus only now are people starting to [use it and such].  It is important to perform research and start finding ways to better predict how cannabis might effect one individual or another.
# Problem Statement
I will be shooting to achive an RMSE score of 0.75 with the target variable being how one feels about thier symptom after the ingestion of cannabis as this would allow me to confidently state that one's symptom would be between a range of two numbers, should they try the cannabis.
# Data Collection
The data was gathered by Strainprint which is an app that allows users to track the effects of different cannabis products. [more explaination of the data gathered] . I came upon this data via a study [linked here, and also here are some of the results of the study]
